# Schism (Summary)
The purpose of schism is to serve as an organizer
for those with certain memory and attention contraints.

The internet has a whole is generally designed to squeeze
all attention and focus the user possesses into some
kind of content that will serve as a platform for serving
advertisements.

I have found the wider Internet as generally useless and
hostile for this reason. The schism project seeks to be
an oasis from perpetual distraction.

As a frequent user of shells I have found command line
based tools considerably more pallatable for this reason.
I think people really underestimate the creative power
of a blank, or nearly blank screen.

So far, schism is just a smorgaboard of methods and
command line tools for easing my stand of mind. Admittedly,
you have to learn them first. (The are frustrating to start
out with). I've heard programs such as ed called "user-
hostile" which is ridiculuos. Ed's design was dictated
by the need for an editor before monitors replaced printers
as the user interface. It has some delightful features.

## Installing and Using

Right now the schism project is in a "It works on my computer,
it may work on yours. As of 2022-06-15, it has the following
dependancies:

Bash (it's a shell script)
The _play_ command (from the Soxi package)
The _ed_ text editor (often times installed by default on linux)
Some songs. The play feature needs manual selection of your own songs.

I'm thinking of allowing the user to select between nano,ed,vim,and
emacs, provided they are provided on their system.

## Pull Requessts

The current stage of the project is currently firmly in the "I'm
making something I find useful for me here is the code. This code
is meant to provide a focused and distractions free environment
for it's user(s). So anyone thinks the have a handle on that, I
am interested to see what you come up with.
