# schism
The purpose of schism is to serve as an organizer
for those with certain memory and attention contraints.

The internet has a whole is generally designed to squeeze
all attention and focus the user possesses into some
kind of content that will serve as a platform for serving
advertisements.

I have found the wider Internet as generally useless and
hostile for this reason. The schism project seeks to be
an oasis from perpetual distraction.

As a frequent user of shells I have found command line
based tools considerably more pallatable for this reason.
I think people really underestimate the creative power
of a blank, or nearly blank screen.

So far, schism is just a smorgaboard of methods and
command line tools for easing my stand of mind. Admittedly,
you have to learn them first. (The are frustrating to start
out with). I've heard programs such as ed called "user-
hostile" which is ridiculuos. Ed's design was dictated
by the need for an editor before monitors replaced printers
as the user interface. It has some delightful features.
